# PasswordChecker

This repository contains code, and a PDF report, for a stand-alone password checker web application designed for use by children.

This application was created as part of an assessed exercise for the Human-Centred Security course at the University of Glasgow. Furthermore, I participated in this exercise as part of a 3-person team, please see the [report](Report.pdf) for further details on the team.

------------

Alongside the report, our group also produced a video that explains the functionality of the password checker application, and the design decisions that guided us to create an application that achieves the desired security outcomes while best suiting the needs of the intended user demographic (children). The link to the video is [HERE](https://youtu.be/4ivnIqJ8BI8).
