# PasswordChecker

This repository contains code, and a PDF report, for a stand-alone password-checker web application designed for use by children.

This application was created as part of an assessed exercise for the Human-Centred Security course at the University of Glasgow. Furthermore, I participated in this exercise as part of a 3-person team, please see the [report](Report.pdf) for further details on the team.
